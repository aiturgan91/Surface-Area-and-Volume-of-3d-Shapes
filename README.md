## 3D Shapes Polymorphism Project
Project Overview
This Java project demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming principles, specifically focusing on polymorphism, interfaces, and random object generation. The application creates a system for generating and analyzing 3D geometric shapes with dynamic properties.
Key Features

## Polymorphic Shape Generation: Dynamically create Spheres, Cylinders, and Cubes
Shape3DInterface: Common interface for 3D shapes
Random Dimension Generation: Automatic creation of shapes with random sizes
Surface Area and Volume Calculations: Compute geometric properties for each shape

## Polymorphism Explanation
This project exemplifies polymorphism through several key mechanisms:

## Interface-Based Polymorphism:

The Shape3DInterface defines a common contract for all 3D shapes
Different shape classes (Sphere, Cylinder, Cube) implement this interface
Each shape provides its unique implementation of surfaceArea() and volume() methods


## Runtime Polymorphism:

Shapes are created and stored in a common Shape3DInterface array
Different shape types can be treated uniformly through the interface
Method calls are dynamically resolved based on the actual object type
